'''
every character in second block chain is greater than first blockchain
both are in descending order (1)
if first not in descending order, will have at least two character ascending, will definitely have third character which is illegal
if second not in descending order, will have two character ascending (1), definitely first character exist in first block chain (1)
if only 2 characters and 1 character then is obviously desciending (1)
