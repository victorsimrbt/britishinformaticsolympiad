'''
a square is part of a loop if a line goes through it
a square can only be part of 2 loops if it is tile1 or tile2
however, no loop can be formed from only tile1 and tile2, as they will not connect
the diagonal pieces (3,4,5,6)

fill the 500 by 500 with only piece 2
place 


impossible (1), as all loops cover an even number of squares (1)
no lines goes past two lines
so the total of all the loops will be even
the total score of red must be even
even - 1 is odd (1)
which would be impossible to achieve as the sum of even numbers will always be even (1)
