# British Informatics Olympiad Solutions

This repository contains extremely rough and scrappy solutions for the British Informatics Olympiad. R1 questions should be mostly complete but R2 questions are largely incomplete. Most questions have solutions for parts a, b and c but some of the written sections have not yet been completed.

If you have solved questions that are not solved in this repository feel free to open pull requests.
