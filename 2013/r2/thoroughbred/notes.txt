Observations:
 - the first character is the name of the offspring
 - problem seems recursive

Initial Approach:
- take the first character of the modern record as the child
- the father must be the characters that come after the child in the antiquated record
- the characters that come before the child in the antiquated record it must be the mother

worked example:
7 3 4 1 8 9 6 5 2
4 3 1 9 8 6 7 5 2

7 is the child

5 2 is the father:
    in modern: is 5 2
    in antiquated: is 5 2
    5 is the father
    2 must be father or mother
    offspring of 2 is 5

4 3 1 9 8 6 is the mother:
    in modern: 3 4 1 8 9 6
    in antiquated: 4 3 1 9 8 6

    the mother must be 3
    the mothers' mother must be 4
    the mothers' father is 1 8 9 6 (1 9 8 6)

- seems doable but idk how fast the algorithm would be
