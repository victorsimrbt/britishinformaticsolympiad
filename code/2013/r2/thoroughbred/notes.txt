Observations:
 - the first character is the name of the offspring
 - problem seems recursive

Initial Approach:
- take the first character of the modern record as the child
- the father must be the characters that come after the child in the antiquated record
- the characters that come before the child in the antiquated record it must be the mother


recursively solve, function returns when only one character left

also it is impossible for any  bird apart from the child described to have no offspring:
    -  if it is not the child and involved, it must be related to the parents in some way
    - only way related is to be parent of the bird
    - so must have offspring

worked example:
7 3 4 1 8 9 6 5 2
4 3 1 9 8 6 7 5 2

7 is the child

5 2 is the father:
    in modern: is 5 2
    in antiquated: is 5 2
    5 is the father
    2 must be father or mother
    offspring of 2 is 5

4 3 1 9 8 6 is the mother:
    in modern: 3 4 1 8 9 6
    in antiquated: 4 3 1 9 8 6

    the mother must be 3
    the mothers' mother must be 4
    the mothers' father is 1 8 9 6 (1 9 8 6)




- seems doable but idk how fast the algorithm would be
