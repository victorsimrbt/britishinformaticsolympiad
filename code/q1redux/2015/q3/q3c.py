'''
every artist different just means that no characters between the two list have same
value and position

this means that the first character must change (1)
the values after the last configuration of a character are in descending order (1)
the next configuration will be the next first character and the rest in ascending order

the next first character must be the middle character of the descending order

it is impossible (1)

the first character must change in 1 arrangement
which means that all the other characters are in descending
so it means that the first character cannot change again
which is only possible if there are two characters
as if there is more, there is more than one configuration for each starting letter
however, with two characters, there are only two configurations, which does not allow for the n+2nd arrangmeent to exist
if there are repeated characters, there will definitely be repeats
