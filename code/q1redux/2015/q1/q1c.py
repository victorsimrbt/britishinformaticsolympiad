'''
the length of the block palindrome must be even (1)
the only possibility is two repeated words like LOP LOP where the first and last character are not repeated (1)
if the words are not repeated it will result in no groupings
if it is an even length palindrome, the two middle characters can be grouped together, which results in an odd number of blocsk
if it is an odd length palindrome, you can make each block 1 character, resulting in an odd number of blocks
for palindrome, two on the edge will be a block each and middle section one block. (1)
so cannot be palindrome
it can only have 1 grouping (1)
just itself twice 
the block can only be the word
